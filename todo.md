# GPT Engineer GUI Project - Progress and Next Steps

## Project Overview
The GPT Engineer GUI project aims to create a graphical user interface for the GPT Engineer tool, which currently operates as a command-line application. GPT Engineer allows users to specify software requirements in natural language and have AI generate the corresponding code.

## Current Progress

- ‚úÖ Basic UI framework with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS is set up
- ‚úÖ Project structure and component architecture is defined
- ‚úÖ Dashboard for viewing and managing projects
- ‚úÖ Project creation workflow
- ‚úÖ Project workspace with code editor and file explorer
- ‚úÖ Settings management
- ‚úÖ Dark/light mode support
- ‚úÖ State management with React Context
- ‚úÖ File upload functionality
- ‚úÖ Project export as ZIP
- ‚úÖ Image reference support
