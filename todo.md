# GPT Engineer GUI Project - Progress and Next Steps

## Project Overview
The GPT Engineer GUI project aims to create a graphical user interface for the GPT Engineer tool, which currently operates as a command-line application. GPT Engineer allows users to specify software requirements in natural language and have AI generate the corresponding code.

## Current Progress

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Core GPT Engineer functionality is implemented and working
- ‚úÖ CLI commands (`gpte`, `ge`, `gpte`) are functional
- ‚úÖ Documentation structure with Sphinx and Read the Docs is set up
- ‚úÖ Testing framework is in place with test cases for code improvement functionality
- ‚úÖ Project dependency management with Poetry
- ‚úÖ Roadmap for future development is defined

### In Progress
- üîÑ Documentation content is being developed
- üîÑ Testing coverage is being expanded

### Not Started
- ‚ùå GUI implementation has not been started
- ‚ùå Integration between GUI and core GPT Engineer functionality
- ‚ùå User experience design for the GUI
- ‚ùå GUI testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. **Design GUI Architecture**
   - Choose a GUI framework (options: PyQt, Tkinter, Electron, or web-based)
   - Create wireframes for the main interface
   - Define user workflows and interaction patterns

2. **Implement Basic GUI Shell**
   - Create the main application window
   - Implement basic navigation structure
   - Set up project configuration screens

3. **Connect Core Functionality**
   - Create interface between GUI and existing GPT Engineer functions
   - Implement prompt input mechanism
   - Display generated code in the GUI

### Medium-term Goals (1-3 Months)
1. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Add syntax highlighting for code display
   - Implement project management features
   - Create settings panel for API keys and model selection

2. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Real-time code generation feedback
   - Code editing capabilities within the GUI
   - Project history and versioning

3. **Improve Documentation**
   - Add GUI-specific documentation
   - Create user guides with screenshots
   - Update installation instructions for GUI version

### Long-term Goals (3+ Months)
1. **Platform Support**
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Create installers for each platform
   - Consider mobile/tablet support

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Add integration with code editors (VS Code, etc.)
   - Support for version control systems
   - Plugin system for extensibility

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize for large projects
   - Implement caching for faster responses
   - Add offline capabilities where possible

## Technical Considerations
- The GUI should maintain the same model flexibility as the CLI version
- Consider accessibility requirements from the beginning
- Ensure the GUI doesn't compromise the power and flexibility of the CLI version

## Resources Needed
- GUI development expertise (PyQt/Tkinter/Electron)
- UX/UI design input
- Additional testing resources for GUI components
- Documentation writers familiar with GUI applications

## Contribution Opportunities
- GUI framework selection and initial setup
- Wireframe and UI design
- Integration between existing code and GUI
- Documentation for GUI features
- Cross-platform testing
