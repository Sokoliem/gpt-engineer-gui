# GPT Engineer GUI Project - Progress and Next Steps

## Project Overview
The GPT Engineer GUI project aims to create a graphical user interface for the GPT Engineer tool, which currently operates exclusively as a command-line application. This GUI will make the powerful code generation capabilities of GPT Engineer accessible to users who prefer visual interfaces over command-line tools.

## Current Progress

### Completed
- ✅ Core GPT Engineer functionality is implemented and working via CLI
- ✅ CLI commands (`gpte`, `ge`, `gpte`) are functional
- ✅ Documentation structure with Sphinx and Read the Docs is set up
- ✅ Testing framework is in place with test cases for code improvement functionality
- ✅ Project dependency management with Poetry
- ✅ Roadmap for future development is defined

### Not Started
- ❌ GUI implementation has not been started
- ❌ Integration between GUI and core GPT Engineer functionality
- ❌ User experience design for the GUI
- ❌ GUI testing

## Next Steps: GUI Implementation

### Phase 1: UI Design and Framework Selection (1-2 weeks)

1. **Select UI Framework**
   - **Options Analysis:**
     - **Web-based (Recommended)**: React + Vite for frontend, with Flask/FastAPI backend to interface with GPT Engineer core
     - **Desktop Native**: Electron (web tech in desktop app), PyQt/PySide6, or Tkinter
   - **Decision Criteria**: Cross-platform support, developer familiarity, integration ease with Python backend, modern UI capabilities

2. **Design Core UI Components**
   - **Project Dashboard**
     - Project listing with status indicators
     - Quick access to recent projects
     - New project creation button
   
   - **Prompt Editor**
     - Rich text editor for writing prompts
     - Template selection
     - Prompt history/versioning
     - Prompt validation and suggestions
   
   - **Code Generation Workspace**
     - Split view: prompt on left, generated code on right
     - Code editor with syntax highlighting
     - File tree navigation for generated project
     - Real-time generation status indicators
   
   - **Settings Panel**
     - API key configuration
     - Model selection (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
     - Custom preprompt configuration
     - Theme and UI preferences

### Phase 2: Core UI Implementation (2-4 weeks)

1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Create separate frontend directory
   - Configure build system
   - Set up communication layer between UI and core GPT Engineer

2. **Implement Basic UI Shell**
   - Main application layout
   - Navigation between main views
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

3. **Develop Key Components**
   - Project creation flow
   - Prompt input mechanism
   - Code display with syntax highlighting
   - Basic settings management

4. **Core Integration**
   - Connect UI to existing GPT Engineer functions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states and progress indicators

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)

1. **Project Management**
   - Project templates
   - Export/import functionality
   - Project settings and configuration

2. **Advanced Code Interaction**
   - In-place code editing
   - Code search and navigation
   - Code explanation features
   - Diff view for code improvements

3. **Collaboration Features**
   - Project sharing (if applicable)
   - Export to GitHub/GitLab
   - Comment/annotation system

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing (2 weeks)

1. **UI Polish**
   - Animation and transitions
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Dark/light theme support

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for UI components
   - Integration tests with core functionality
   - User testing and feedback collection
   - Performance optimization

3. **Documentation**
   - User guide with screenshots
   - Installation instructions
   - API documentation for potential extensions

## UI Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Keep the interface clean and focused on the primary task of generating code from prompts
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide advanced options until needed
3. **Consistent Feedback**: Always show the system status during code generation
4. **Familiar Patterns**: Use UI patterns common in code editors and IDEs
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the interface is usable by people with disabilities

## Technical Implementation Considerations

1. **State Management**: Use appropriate state management for the selected framework (Redux, Context API, etc.)
2. **API Design**: Create a clean API layer between the UI and core GPT Engineer functionality
3. **Performance**: Optimize for handling large code files and projects
4. **Extensibility**: Design components to be reusable and extensible
5. **Testing**: Implement automated testing from the beginning

## Avoiding Duplication

To avoid duplicating components and functionality:

1. **Leverage Existing Core Logic**: The UI should be a thin layer on top of the existing GPT Engineer core functionality
2. **Reuse Command Structure**: Map UI actions directly to existing CLI commands where possible
3. **Maintain Configuration Compatibility**: Ensure settings in the UI generate the same configuration files used by the CLI
4. **Share Code Processing Logic**: Use the same code parsing, formatting, and display logic across platforms
5. **Unified Documentation**: Extend existing documentation rather than creating separate docs

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Create wireframes for the main UI components
2. Set up the basic project structure for the selected UI framework
3. Implement a simple proof-of-concept that connects the UI to one core GPT Engineer function
4. Get early feedback from current CLI users about the proposed UI design
