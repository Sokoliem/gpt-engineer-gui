# GPT Engineer GUI Development Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the GPT Engineer project. The GUI will make the powerful code generation capabilities of GPT Engineer accessible to users who prefer visual interfaces over command-line tools.

## Project Analysis

GPT Engineer is a tool that:
- Takes natural language prompts describing software requirements
- Uses AI (primarily OpenAI models) to generate complete code implementations
- Supports improving existing code bases
- Includes benchmarking capabilities
- Supports various models including OpenAI, Azure, and local open-source models

The current interface is command-line based, requiring users to:
1. Create project directories
2. Write prompt files
3. Run CLI commands with specific flags
4. View results in their file system
